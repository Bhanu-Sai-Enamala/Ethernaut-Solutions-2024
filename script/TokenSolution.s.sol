Explanation:

### Overview of the Exploit:

This solution exploits an integer underflow vulnerability in the Token contract from the Ethernaut challenge. The contract fails to correctly handle cases where a user attempts to transfer more tokens than they have. As a result, an underflow occurs, boosting the player's balance to a very high number.

### Vulnerability Details:

The following code is used in the `transfer` function to check the balance:
   ```solidity
   require(balances[msg.sender] - _value >= 0);
   This line is intended to check whether the sender has enough tokens to transfer. However, in Solidity versions prior to 0.8.0, this check does not prevent underflows. When the amount _value is greater than balances[msg.sender], the subtraction causes an underflow, and the balance wraps around to a very large number (as Solidity uses unsigned integers). As a result, the attacker ends up with a massive balance.
	1.	The attacker tries to transfer 30 tokens to their own address.
	2.	Since the attacker has a lower balance than the amount being transferred, the balances[msg.sender] - _value operation underflows.
	3.	This underflow causes the playerâ€™s balance to become extremely high (due to the wrapping around of the unsigned integer).
	4.	With this high balance, the attacker can now drain the Token contract of its funds or manipulate the system.

Explanation:

This script is the solution to the "Fallback" challenge in Ethernaut, where the goal is to become the owner of the contract and withdraw all its funds. 

1. **Contributing 1 wei**: The contract has a function `contribute()` that adds to the senderâ€™s contributions. By contributing 1 wei, we meet the requirement to interact with the contract.
   
2. **Triggering the fallback function**: By sending 1 wei using a low-level call (`call{value: 1 wei}("")`), we trigger the contract's `receive()` fallback function, which transfers ownership of the contract to the caller (`msg.sender`). The fallback function assigns ownership when the sender has already contributed and sends ether directly.

3. **Withdrawing the funds**: Once we become the owner, we can call the `withdraw()` function, which is protected by the `onlyOwner` modifier. This allows us to withdraw all the ether in the contract.

The script needs to be run on the network after replacing the instance address. After successfully running the script, the challenge will be completed as we will have drained the contract.
